# PROG 2700 - Tech Check 1

### JavaScript Fundamentals

**Value:** 7.5% of overall course mark  

### PhoneWords

Create a JavaScript application that will convert a *PhoneWord* or Vanity Number (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneword) to a set of numbers. An example would be taking 1-800-HOLIDAY and getting 18004654329. 

The image below shows the keypad you will be emulating:

**Note:** in North America, the alphabet begins with the number 2 on the keypad. You have been provided with starter code in this repository (index.html and main.js). The code that you are asked to write should go in the function indicated called *convertPhoneWord*. The script will execute a *testFunction()* function that will test your code.  Errors will be written to the console until your code is sufficient implemented. **Do not write any code outside of the area indicated.**

#### Requirements
Given any PhoneWord:
+ Ignore any non -alphanumeric characters: (), -, etc.
+ Keep any existing digits
+ Resolve a letter to a number according to the keypad image
+ Complete the *convertPhoneWord* function such that all tests pass. 
(Note: your solution must ultimately work for ANY provided Phoneword. The tests are there to simply provide a quick check on the efficacy of your solution. So coding a 'phony' solution to solely make the tests pass will be rejected.)

#### Submission Instructions

Once your program is complete, or if you run out of in-class time to complete the Tech Check, commit and push your code to GitHub with the commit message "End of Class"

If you complete the Tech Check outside of class time, commit and push your subsequent code additions and changes with the commit message "Ready for Marking"
